## Install Git and Stow

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an open source version control system. In principle one can download this repository manually, as a compressed package, but I highly recommend to install `git` first and then use it to pull all the files automatically.  

```bash
sudo apt-get install git --yes
sudo apt-get install stow --yes
```

## Clone the repository

Use `git` command to clone this repository into your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngryMaciek/small-dotfiles.git
```

## Stow the dotfiles

Use `stow` to ...:
```bash
?
```
